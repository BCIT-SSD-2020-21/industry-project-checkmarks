            Below are some rules of thumb regarding Trademarks as provided by
            the Canadian Intellectual Property Office.{' '}
        </h5>

        <h3>Names and Surnames</h3>
        <p>
            A trademark may not be registered if it is nothing more than a name
            or surname. An exception is if you can prove that your goods or
            services have become well known under the name or surname so that
            the word has acquired a second meaning in the public mind.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Clearly descriptive marks</h3>
        <p>
            You may not register a trademark that clearly describes a
            characteristic or quality of your goods or services.
        </p>
        <h3>Clearly descriptive marks</h3>
        <p>
            You may not register a trademark that clearly describes a
            characteristic or quality of your goods or services.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Deceptively misdescriptive marks</h3>
        <p>
            You may not register a trademark that describes the geographical
            location where the goods or services come from. Allowing you to use
            such place names as your trademark would mean you are the only one
            who can use the geographical place name, and that would be unfair to
            others who trade in that place. For example, you could not register
            "Italy" for lasagna. Also, you may not register a word that misleads
            the public into thinking that the goods or services come from a
            certain place when they do not. For example, you could not register
            "Paris Fashions" or "Denmark Furniture" as a trademark for goods or
            services if they did not come from there.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Words in other languages</h3>
        <p>
            You may not register trademarks that are the name, in any language,
            of the goods or services associated with your trademark. For
            example, you would not be able to register the word "gelato"
            (Italian for "ice cream") in association with frozen confections;
            "anorak" (Inuktitut for "parka") in association with outerwear; or
            "wurst" (German for "sausage") in association with meat.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Confusing with a registered or pending trademark</h3>
        <p>
            Beware of trademarks that are similar to another trademark that is
            registered or is the subject of a previously-filed application. If
            your trademark is confusingly similar to a registered trademark or a
            pending trademark, it will be refused.{' '}
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>
            Trademarks that are identical to, or likely to be mistaken for,
            prohibited marks
        </h3>
        <p>
            You may not register a trademark that is identical or similar to
            certain official marks unless you have the permission from the
            organization that controls the mark.
        </p>
